## Modern definition:  
"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

## Supervised learning:
we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output  
- Regression: predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.  
- Classification: predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.
